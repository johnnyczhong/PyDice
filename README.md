# PyDice
## A simple dice roller for Python3

## I wrote this on a Saturday morning in preparation for a
## DnD group I'm playing with. Hope someone finds this helpful!

### Basic usage:
### To roll a dice: 'roll x' where x is something like 1d20+5. the + modifier is optional
### To set an action: 'set x y' where x is an unspaced string.
### y is the same dice format as is required to roll.
### To call this, type 'roll <action>'
### For example, 'set axe 1d20+5' will set your axe action to 1d20+5.
### If you want to call your axe action, just type: 'roll axe'
